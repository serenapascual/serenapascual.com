          <p>My name is Serena Pascual. I'm a computer science major and music minor due to graduate in May 2019 from San Jose State University. An artist at heart and software engineer by trade, I seek to join my enthusiasm for technology with my love for all things visual, performing, and literary art.
          <p>Through this website, I document my creative efforts and personal endeavors in the realm of software development. I figured that this project would aid in retention of what I learn while serving as an exercise in web design.
