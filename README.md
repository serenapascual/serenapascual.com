# serenapascual.com
Personal website built with Gatsby and a pinch of three.js. View it [live](https://serenapascual.com).

## About
This site serves as a display of self-expression, an exercise in web development, and a value to fill in the "website" field on forms.

## To-do
- Add interactivity, perhaps:
  - Window view based on cursor
  - Animated SVG
- Redesign projects page to display in-app
